== Control Tower integration guide

This guide will help you integrate Terraform with AWS Control Tower using the
tfctl wrapper.  This involves setting up resources for remote state tracking,
necessary IAM roles and a tfctl project.

=== Overview

For state tracking we're going to create a dedicated `shared-services` account
under a `mgmt` organization unit.  We'll use S3 for state storage and DynamoDB
for locking.  A dedicated `TerraformState` IAM role will be created for access
to state resources cross account from the primary account.

In the primary account we'll create a `TfctlOrgAccess` role.  It gives tfctl
ready only access to AWS Organizations which is used to discover accounts and
the organization unit structure.

We'll use CloudFormation stacks and stack-sets to bootstrap those resources.

For executing Terraform in spoke accounts we'll utilise the
`AWSControlTowerExecution` role which is automatically created by Control Tower
account factory and can be assumed from the primary account.

For the sake of an example we're going to create a couple of organization units
in Control Tower: `live` and `test` and provision some accounts for testing.

=== Prerequisites

Before starting you'll need:

 * Control Tower set up in your primary account.
 * A user with `AdministratorAccess` privileges in primary account.
 * AWS CLI tools installed on your machine.
 * Terraform 0.12 or higher.

=== Control Tower configuration

Create the following organization units in Control Tower:

 * `mgmt`
 * `live`
 * `test`

Then provision accounts:

 * In `mgmt` OU create an account called `mgmt-shared-services`
 * In `live` create `live-example1`
 * In `test` create `test-example1`

NOTE: Control Tower accounts need to be provisioned one at a time.  It takes
approximately 20 mins to provision one.

=== Install tfctl

----
git clone git@github.com:scalefactory/tfctl.git
cd tfctl/ && sudo make install
----

=== Set up AWS resources

It's assumed you have configured AWS CLI access to the primary account.

We'll use CloudFormation templates in `examples/bootstrap/`.

First export configuration using environment variables making sure to change to
values to suit your set up:

----
export PRIMARY_ACCOUNT_ID=11111111
export SHARED_SERVICES_ACCOUNT_ID=22222222
export STATE_BUCKET_NAME='example-terraform-state'
----

Create the remote state resources stack set:

----
cd examples/bootstrap/

aws cloudformation create-stack-set \
    --stack-set-name TerraformState \
    --template-body file://terraform-state.template \
    --description "Resources for managing Terraform state" \
    --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM CAPABILITY_IAM \
    --execution-role-name AWSControlTowerExecution \
    --administration-role-arn arn:aws:iam::${PRIMARY_ACCOUNT_ID}:role/service-role/AWSControlTowerStackSetRole \
    --parameters ParameterKey=PrimaryAccountId,ParameterValue=${PRIMARY_ACCOUNT_ID} \
    ParameterKey=TerraformStateBucket,ParameterValue=${STATE_BUCKET_NAME}
----

Create a stack set instance in you shared services account:

----
aws cloudformation create-stack-instances \
    --stack-set-name TerraformState \
    --accounts ${SHARED_SERVICES_ACCOUNT_ID} \
    --regions eu-west-1
----

Check status:

----
aws cloudformation describe-stack-instance \
    --stack-set-name TerraformState \
    --stack-instance-account ${SHARED_SERVICES_ACCOUNT_ID} \
    --stack-instance-region eu-west-1
----

NOTE: Initial status will be `OUTDATED`, it should change to `CURRENT` once deployed.

Deploy `TfctlOrgAccess` IAM role stack:

----
aws cloudformation create-stack \
    --stack-name TfctlOrgAccess \
    --template-body file://tfctl-org-access.template \
    --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM CAPABILITY_IAM \
    --parameters ParameterKey=PrimaryAccountId,ParameterValue=${PRIMARY_ACCOUNT_ID}
----

Check status:

----
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name TfctlOrgAccess
----

NOTE: Successful status should read: `CREATE_COMPLETE`.

=== Configure tfctl

Copy the example project directory `examples/control_tower` somewhere convenient
and edit `conf/example.yaml`.

You need to modify the following parameters:

 * `tf_state_bucket` - set to `$STATE_BUCKET_NAME`
 * `tf_state_role_arn` - set shared services account ID
 * `tfctl_role_arn` - set primary account ID
 * `primary_account` - set the primary account name.  You can find it in AWS Organizations.

TIP: You should keep your project directory under version control.

=== Deploy example tfctl profile

The example profile will create an S3 bucket in accounts under `test`, `live`
and `mgmt` OUs.

NOTE: Run tfctl commands from the root of you project directory.

First dump the configuration to verify everything works:

----
tfctl -c conf/example.yaml -s
----

This will not make any changes but will print out a yaml containing the final,
merged configuration data.  It should contain a list of discovered accounts and
their configuration.

Initialise terraform for all discovered accounts:

----
tfctl -c conf/example.yaml --all -- init
----

Tfctl will run Terraform against all accounts in parallel.

Run plan:

----
tfctl -c conf/example.yaml --all -- plan
----

and apply:

----
tfctl -c conf/example.yaml --all -- apply
----

To destroy created resources run:

----
tfctl -c conf/example.yaml --all -- destroy -auto-approve
----

That's it! You can now execute terraform across your Control Tower estate.

TIP: Your project directory should be under version control excluding the
`.tfctl` directory which is automatically generated.
